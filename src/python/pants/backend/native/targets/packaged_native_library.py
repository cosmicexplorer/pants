  This target type is intended to be generated by a codegen task to wrap various sources of C/C++
  packages in a homogenous container. It can also be used to wrap native libraries which are checked
  into the repository -- the `sources` argument does not allow files outside of the buildroot.

  NB: Currently, the compile and link tasks will assume that header files are placed in a subdirectory
  named `include/` in this target's directory.
