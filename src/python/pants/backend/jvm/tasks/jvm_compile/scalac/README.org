#+TITLE: scalac compilation with graal native-image
#+STARTUP: showall

This is done as an experiment in compiling scala using the GraalVM's ~native-image~ /(link!)/ tool, executing through the SubstrateVM.

* TODO [0/2]
- [ ] add reflections and substitutions per-tool
    - this should be configurable with an option, as it will depend on the tool used
        - different than a scalac plugin, but *maybe similar*
    - see [[file:///home/cosmicexplorer/tools/graalvm-demos/scala-days-2018/scalac-native/scalac-image.sh][scalac-image.sh]]
- [ ] let the task hook into the ~GraalExecutor~ to add things like the bootclasspath
    - see [[file:///home/cosmicexplorer/tools/pants/scalac-native][scalac-native]]

** Benchmark TODO [0/1]
- [ ] use ~JavacCompile~ to compile ~java_sources~!
